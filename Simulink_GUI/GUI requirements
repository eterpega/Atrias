Simulink Model details for GUI specs:

 In the 'leg' model, safety implemenation is in the 'Safety' subsystem.
 The Mux that provides input to the scope will have the status for all safety checks.
 The first input is the result of all safety checks (true if safe to operate).
 The second input is the result of checking temp, collisions, finite values, and error flags.
 The second input is true if the 4 above checks all return true.
 The other inputs are the results of checking temperature, collision, sanity, and eror flags.

How to launch existing GUI:

roslaunch atrias orocos_csim.launch 
new window
roslaunch atrias gui.launch
