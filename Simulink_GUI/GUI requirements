Simulink GUI Specifications: 

1.	Read Thermistor, model, and leg data on the GUI
2.	Real-time leg positioning and update leg positioning 
3.	Emergency stop button and Simulink config buttons 
4.	Everything about motor must be on Simulink 

Features:

1.  Enable, Emergency, start, and stop buttons 
2.  Real-Leg motion plot ( Compass Plot? Polar Plot? )
3.  Graphs and status of model 
4.  Log file 

Dr. Hurst Initial Response: 

1. Redesign Robot Status Panel

2. Remove Unnecessary graphs 


Graphs on the GUI: 
Control, Motor Control graphs on GUI, Temperature 

Simulink Model details for GUI specs:

 In the 'leg' model, safety implemenation is in the 'Safety' subsystem.
 The Mux that provides input to the scope will have the status for all safety checks.
 The first input is the result of all safety checks (true if safe to operate).
 The second input is the result of checking temp, collisions, finite values, and error flags.
 The second input is true if the 4 above checks all return true.
 The other inputs are the results of checking temperature, collision, sanity, and eror flags.

How to launch existing GUI:

roslaunch atrias orocos_csim.launch 
new window
roslaunch atrias gui.launch
