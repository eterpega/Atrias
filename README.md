Dynamic Robotics Project
================

###Description:

The goal of this project is to replace the software system for ATRIAS with MATLAB and Simulink Realtime.
The ATRIAS is a walking, running, and jumping bipedal robot created in the Dynamic Robotics Lab at Oregon State University.

EtherCAT is the communication protocol we will use for the system, in order to interface with our custom Medulla microcontrollers and Elmo amplifiers.
