%CONTROL_INTERFACE M-file for Control_Interface.fig
%      CONTROL_INTERFACE, by itself, creates a new CONTROL_INTERFACE or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = CONTROL_INTERFACE returns the handle to a new CONTROL_INTERFACE or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      CONTROL_INTERFACE('Property','Value',...) creates a new CONTROL_INTERFACE using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to Control_Interface_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      CONTROL_INTERFACE('CALLBACK') and CONTROL_INTERFACE('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in CONTROL_INTERFACE.M with the given input
%      arguments.
