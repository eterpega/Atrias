Safety Specifications to Implement in Simulink RT

Safety Overview:

Conditions for an emergency stop:
  -Invalid current values
    -Anything non-finite  
  
Conditions for a halt:
  -Leg collisions
  -Any Medulla is in a halt state
  -Temperature exceeds limits  

Emergency Stop Specifications:
  currentCheck block:
    Check that motor current values are finite i.e. not inf or NaN. 

Halt Specifications:
  checkMedullaHalt block:
    Check if any Medullas are in halt state

  predictStop block:
    Use current position and current velocity to predict stopping location

  checkCollision block:
    Check if motor exceeded limits based on min/max location and safety distance
    Check if leg length limit has been exceeded

  temperature block:
    Check if thermistor reading has exceeded 80 celsius
