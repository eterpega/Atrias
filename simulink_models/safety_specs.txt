Safety Specifications to Implement in Simulink RT

Safety Overview:

Conditions for an emergency stop:
  -Invalid current values
    -Anything non-finite
  -Motors outside of safe velocity range
  -If we are in a system halt state
  
Conditions for a halt:
  -Leg collisions
  -Any Medulla is in a halt state
  
Emergency Stop Specifications:
  currentCheck block:
    Check that motor current values are finite i.e. not inf or NaN.
