Meeting Minutes for 6/19/14

Participants: Sean Penney, Daniel Lin

Location: DRL

Goals:
Get mathworks software working, continue to setup amplifier/motor


What did we accomplish: Went through tutorials

Wiring was setup with the help of Patrick, REU student from UCSB; he is working on configuring the amplifier. 
Josh, high school intern, joined our group and is helping us with MATLAB programming. 
We got MATLAB 2014a installed on the lab computer. However, licensing is still an issue.
