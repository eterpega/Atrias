Meeting Minutes for 5/15/14

Participants: Sean Penney, John Cargill, Daniel Lin

Location: Robotics Lab

so we can put it in our formal request for hardware and software.

Notes: Hurst has told us that depending on our performance being
hired over Summer is an option.

For choosing the right ethernet card we have been told that documentation on the
internet is not completely reliable, and that it will be best to guess and check 
our currently available cards.

Future Improvements:
