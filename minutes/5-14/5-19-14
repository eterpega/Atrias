Meeting Minutes for 5/19/14

Participants: Sean Penney, John Cargill, Daniel Lin

Location: Robotics Lab

Goals: Ask about receiving a Matlab account with licenses 
to access documentation.  Ask Michael about MATLAB libraries to get from  Michigan.

Notes: Tried to trouble shoot XPC target. 

Future Improvements: On Wednesday we want to type up the requirements formally and
send them to Hurst.  We also want the official MATLAB documentation that comes with
the new licenses that we are asking for. Also, fiddle around with XPC target.
